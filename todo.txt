1. Hash the passwords = done?
2. Done. However, when a user selects no component, there should be no options in the export page (When no component is selected the entire module disappears)
3. Change layout of export page
4. Done in case the user selects through table. (When two dates are selected for export, the endDate should be later then startDate)
5. In the general info page, add a row stating the component name, and its ip address. 
6. Move 'My Account' in the nav-bar to the right
7. Register and update form, add @ symbol.
8. Easter egg challenge: find and remove the hidden debug messages. (Hint: They are all over the place)
